## Create a new vetiver model 🌳🌴🌲🌲🌴🌳🌴🌳🌲

Fit a random forest model

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(arrow)
set.seed(123)

path <- here::here("data", "housing.parquet")
housing <- read_parquet(path)

set.seed(123)
housing_split <- housing |>
  mutate(price = log10(price)) |>
  initial_split(prop = 0.8)
housing_train <- training(housing_split)
housing_test <- testing(housing_split)

housing_fit <-
  workflow(
    price ~ bedrooms + bathrooms + sqft_living + yr_built,
    rand_forest(trees = 200, mode = "regression")
  ) |>
  fit(data = housing_train)
```

Store your model on Posit Connect:

```{r}
library(vetiver)
library(pins)

v <- vetiver_model(model = housing_fit, model_name = "bensoltoff/seattle-housing-rf")
board <- board_connect(auth = "envvar", server = "https://pub.vetiver.posit.team/")
board |> vetiver_pin_write(v)
```

## Model Card ❤️

Open the Model Card template in RStudio by choosing "File" ➡️ "New File" ➡️ "R Markdown" ➡️ "From Template" ➡️ "Vetiver Model Card".  

## Create a vetiver REST API 🏺

```{r}
library(plumber)

pr() |>
  vetiver_api(v) |>
  pr_run()
```

## Deploy to Posit Connect 🚀

```{r}
vetiver_deploy_rsconnect(board, name = "bensoltoff/seattle-housing-rf", server = "pub.vetiver.posit.team")
```

## Call your new API endpoints ☎️

Return predictions from your model API:

```{r}
url <- "https://pub.vetiver.posit.team/seattle-housing-rf/predict"
endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint(url)
predict(endpoint, new_data = slice_sample(housing_test, n = 10))
```

Optional: try `/metadata` or `/ping` here:

```{r}
url <- "https://pub.vetiver.posit.team/seattle-housing-rf/ping"
r <- httr::GET(url)
r <- httr::content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
jsonlite::fromJSON(r)
```

Return predictions from **your neighbor's** model API:

```{r}
url <- "https://pub.vetiver.posit.team/content/ce7cfd34-64fd-4e31-9edc-04b72946d46f/predict"
endpoint_akshay <- vetiver_endpoint(url)
predict(endpoint_akshay, slice_sample(housing_test, n = 10))
```


## Model input prototype 🔀

For our R model:

```{r}
url <- "https://pub.demo.posit.team/public/seattle-housing-rstats/prototype"
r <- httr::GET(url)
prototype <- httr::content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
jsonlite::fromJSON(prototype)
```

For our Python model:

```{r}
url <- "https://pub.demo.posit.team/public/seattle-housing-python/prototype"
r <- httr::GET(url)
prototype <- httr::content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
jsonlite::fromJSON(prototype)
```

Make a custom input data prototype after checking out this documentation:
<https://rstudio.github.io/vetiver-r/reference/vetiver_model.html#details>

```{r}
v <- vetiver_model(housing_fit, "seattle-house-rf",
  save_prototype = housing_train |>
    select(bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, yr_built) |>
    slice(1)
)

pr() |>
  vetiver_api(v) |>
  pr_run()
```
